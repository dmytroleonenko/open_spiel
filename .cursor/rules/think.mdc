Claude Think Tool Usage Guidelines

The Think tool provides Claude with a dedicated space for structured thinking, enabling more complex reasoning and problem-solving. Use this tool in the following scenarios:

1. **Complex Multi-Step Problems**: When a problem requires breaking down into smaller, logical steps, especially those involving dependencies between steps.

2. **Reasoning Through Constraints**: When you need to analyze multiple constraints, requirements, or conditions simultaneously.

3. **Policy Adherence**: When strict adherence to specific guidelines, rules, or policies is required.

4. **Planning Complex Operations**: When organizing a complex series of actions, especially those requiring tool calls in a specific sequence.

5. **Debugging or Troubleshooting**: When analyzing potential causes and solutions for complex errors.

6. **Decision Making with Many Variables**: When evaluating multiple factors or trade-offs.

The Think tool should NOT be used for:
Simple, straightforward questions
Tasks that don't require multi-step reasoning
Basic information retrieval or summarization
Creative writing or simple generation tasks

When using the Think tool, clearly state the reasoning challenge, break down your thinking into explicit steps, consider multiple angles, and synthesize insights into a coherent solution.
