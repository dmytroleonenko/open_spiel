1. We implement in small increments only.
2. IMPORTANT!!! We test after each incremental change. You ask me to build/test. I give you results
3. Use knowledge graph to retrieve knowledge
4. If your modification is unsuccessful and edit tool didn't do what you asked for:
4.1 IMPORTANT!!! You read the section of file once again !!!
4.2 you do edits very specific to match that part only
5. When introducing new stuff check @long_narde.h. Structures should be properly reflected there.
6. Never change large portions of file in one go
7. You frequently say "Okay" in the very beginning of your reply. Just skip it
8. @long_narde.cc is very long and edit tool struggles with it. Don't do more than one edit in one go. Just iterate one edit at a time to get success rate close to 100%
9. use `git update-index --refresh && git diff --exit-code || git commit -am 'message'` when build/test successful
